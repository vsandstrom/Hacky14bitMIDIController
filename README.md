# Hacky14bitMIDIController
Work in progress 14bit MIDI Controller 

Hacky experiment in using an off-the-shelf teensy 3.2 as a 14bit Midi controller.<br>

This is approximated using an excessive sampling of the ADC and averaging the values, as well as remapping values and filtering out bad ones. 
It is not perfect, but it might work better than nothing.<br>

The project is influenced A LOT from these projects: <br>
